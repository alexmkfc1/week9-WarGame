    <h1 style="text-align: center;";">War Game</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">*For the final project you will be creating an automated version of the classic card game WAR! There are many versions of the game WAR. In this version there are only 2 players.
        <br> *You do not need to do anything special when there is a tie in a round.
        <br> *Think about how you would build this project and write your plan down. Consider classes such as: Card, Deck, Player, as well as what properties and methods they may include.
        <br> // Four suits to represent the appearance (user interface - ui) for your cards
        let cardSuits = ["Spades 🗡️", "Hearts ❤️", "Diamonds 💎", "Clubs 🍀"];
        console.log("Card Suits Example:", cardSuits);
